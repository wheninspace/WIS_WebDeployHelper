# WIS_WebDeployHelper
A tool for greatly facilitating web deployment with LiveCode

This is still a beta version for testing!

## Description
This tool helps you make a more functional web deployment of a LiveCode stack than you can get with just the native standalone builder.

The current version can help you do the following:
- Modify the appearance of the web page that the LC stack resides on (your own logo, background colour etc)
- Add code that will make the stack resize when the browser window is resized, or make the stack stay centred on the web page
- Add code that enables pasting into fields, putting text into the clipboard and launch URLs
- Add code that will give you access to the localStorage functionality, which enables saving data between sessions
- Other minor javaScript helpers - more features will be added

It also helps automating the deployment process, so that you with one click can get the standalone built and uploaded by ftp to your server.

To be of any use, this stack requires LiveCode v10.0.0 dp7+ to run, and a web deployment license for LC10. Apart from that it only uses standard LiveCode controls and widgets.

This tool is free of charge, but if you like my work and want to suppport it you can buy me a coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/riu9yazy7p
